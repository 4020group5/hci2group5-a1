## Assignment Specification


Experimentation/Fitts’ Law

The aim of this part is to apply concepts of experimentation discussed in class and introduce you to Fitts' law. You will compare the throughput of two input devices, the "thumb" and the "index finger". When doing the experiment with the thumb, try using the device with one hand. In doing this experiment you will collect movement time, get experience with data analysis, and write an evaluation report. For this assignment you will need to implement the program on the tablet given to your group.

You are required to design the experiment as per the methods discussed in class, and accompanying papers listed below. You should compare these two devices (index finger vs. thumb). You should run the experiment, analyze the results, and write the report. The program you create should help you carry out the Fitts‟ tapping task. The amplitude of the movement (A) and the target size (W) should be controlled such that you produce a number of different ID conditions. Your program should collect data for the experiment in a manner that can be easily processed for further analysis. Finally, you should be able to provide an answer to the following question: which device has the better throughput?

Carry out the experiment with at least eight (8) participants, each performing at least 10 trials per (A,W) condition . This should give you enough data points to which you can fit the best line.

Your final report should contain:
 - Your experimental design.
 - Equations for MT for both fingers.
 - Graphs of the best-fit lines to the data. Excel has numerous resources for fitting your data
to a best fit curve.
 - Provide an answer to the question “Which device has the better throughput?”
